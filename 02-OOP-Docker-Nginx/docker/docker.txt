- docker-compose.yml file ready
- Docker Engine Run
- go to docker directory from cmd
- run command on wsl2: docker-compose up (It will install all plugin at first and it must be on run to run project)
- docker-compose up -d (Running on Background)
- Run Project on : localhost:8000
- docker ps (This command will show currently running container)
- docker-comose up -d --build (to build our image)
- ssh into docker container: docker exec -it YourDockercontainerName bash (Run composer command here)

// What Docker Can Do (All Advantages in Real Life):
// 1. Same environment for everyone (No “works on my machine”). Without docker- PHP versions differ, Laravel versions differ, extensions differ, os configurations differ.
// 2. Run multiple different versions of PHP/MySQL on one machine
// 3. No need to install PHP, NGINX, MySQL, Redis manually
// 4. Easy deployment (copy container → run), Deploy anywhere (AWS, DigitalOcean, local), Same environment everywhere
// 5. Microservices support (multiple apps communicating)
// 6. Better isolation (Container A: PHP 8.2, Container B: Python)
// 7. Easy backup & restore (Snapshot DB, Snapshot DB, Move DB between machines)
// 8. Scalable architecture, Useful for high-traffic apps. (exmp: 5 Laravel containers, 3 queue worker containers, 2 nginx containers)
// 9. CI/CD automation. Docker works perfectly with:- GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins etc.
// 10. Run services safely without messing OS
// 11. Your stack may include: php-fpm container, nginx container, mysql container, redis container, queue worker container

// When You Do NOT Need Docker: Simple personal/local projects, Beginner-level development, Single-developer projects, Small servers or shared hosting, Shared hosting (cPanel), When speed is more important than isolation

// If we use xdebug or any, we can use a port to make it work properly
// We can use another port to make phpmyadmin interface
// We can make port for customize php.ini file to modify some options.
