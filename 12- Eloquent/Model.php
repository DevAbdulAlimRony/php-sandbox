// Eloquent is a ORM system which is Active Record Pattern.
// The active record pattern is an approach to accessing data in a database. The database table or view is wrapped into a class. After creation of an object with save method, a single row will be created in table. After updating the object, table row will be updated.
// Any Object loaded gets its information from the databse.
// We can use eloquent itself outside of the laravel framewrok, its kind of a component itself.
// We can install it in a vanilla php project also.
