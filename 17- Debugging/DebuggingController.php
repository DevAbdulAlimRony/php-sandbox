// Debugging is a way of finding bugs or identifying problems in a code.
// There are different ways of debugging
// We sometimes use var_dump(), echo() to debug, but for large code its quite critical.
// This is where we use control flow debugger or step debugger that flows line by lne or step by step executing all the necessary functions or methods.

// Popular PHP Extension Xdebug which have bunch of features along with step debugging.
// Xdebug has a handy wizard for set up in windows
// We can set up it using dockwer

// Laravel does NOT include Xdebug
// Laravel’s debugging tools are: dd(), dump(), ray(), laravel telescope, debugbar, Log Channels
